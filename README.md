Setting The Application

	Google Chrome and Safari: 127.0.0.1:8000/SSM_app/authenticate/
	Firefox: localhost:8000/SSM_app/authenticate/

Using The Application
-----------------------------

We have set up three users with three different roles which you can use to login into the application:

User#1:
Username: user1 
Password: something1234
Role: manager
Description: This user can login into the application but cannot get the secret info (the secret key is the task which the user can perform when logging in into the application). 

User#2:
Username: admin 
Password: something1234
Role: admin
Description: This user can login into the application and can request the secret info. 

User#3:
Username: user2 
Password: something1234
Role: regular_user
Description: This user not authenticated to login and can’t request the secret info. 

The time out for the application is 60 second, after that that the session will ends and the user has to login again. You can modify that by going to “settings.py” and modify “SESSION_TIMEOUT = 60” in line 47 to any other time you like.


Accessing The Admin Page:
-----------------------------

You can login to the admin page by typing: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and then using the following credentials:
Username: root
Password: something123

By logging in into the admin page you will be able to register new users, assign roles or create new roles, and delete existing users.
